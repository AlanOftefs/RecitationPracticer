# Mistake Recording
Mistakes recording function is available. Mistakes will be stored each time you finish one test. By viewing "mistakes/mistakes.txt", you can quickly check your weak point.

# Statistics
In case you want to have some fun, we offer you scores recording and time-spent recording function. Follow the instruction that will appear each time you finish a test.

# File Tidying
For now, we haven't supported categorizing your qs files according to your own path solution, which means creating any folders under "/qs" is illegal. Instead, we advise numbering each qs file at the front of their names, in which way you make it more organized.

# Error Checking
If your test is interrupted by certain unexpected reasons, you should view "log/log.txt", and check out the cause by time marked. You may be required to have some programming knowledge.

# Others to be Noticed
You shouldn't view "/cache/cache.txt", or "/scores/scores.txt", or "/times/times.txt"
